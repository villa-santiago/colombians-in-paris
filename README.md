# Colombians in Paris 🇨🇴🇫🇷

**Colombians in Paris** is a community-driven app designed to organize and share the knowledge from the Colombians in Paris WhatsApp group. In the group, people frequently exchange recommendations, promote local services, and support each other — but useful info often gets buried in the chat.

This app turns that ongoing conversation into a bulletin board where members can easily promote and discover services offered by fellow Colombians living in Paris.
